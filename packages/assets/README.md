# VA Mobile Design Library Assets
This repository contains static assets such as fonts and SVG icons for use by VA mobile applications. It does not contain any code, so it is up to the consumer to import these assets into their app.

See example usage in [Icon component](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-library/blob/main/packages/components/src/components/Icon/Icon.tsx) in [mobile-component-library](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-library/blob/main/packages/components/package.json) which can also be passed custom SVGs.
