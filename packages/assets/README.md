# VA Mobile Design Library Assets
This repository contains static assets such as fonts and SVG icons for use by VA mobile applications. It does not contain any code, so it is up to the consumer to import these assets into their app.

The [components package](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-library) contains an Icon convenience component that makes leveraging both the assets package icons and custom ones easy. See code for the [Icon component](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-library/blob/main/packages/components/src/components/Icon/Icon.tsx). Additional documentation can be found in the [Design System section](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-mobile-app/design/Intro) of VA Mobile docs.
